# ChatHAP

ChatHAP is a conversational system for designing haptic vibrations. It integrates various haptic design approaches using a large language model, allowing users to generate vibrations from signal parameters, navigate libraries, and modify existing designs—all through natural language interaction.

## Getting Started  

### 1. Set up the environment  
Create and activate the Conda environment:  
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ChatHAP
```
### 2. Run the ChatHAP server
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```
